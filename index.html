					<p>Hello there. My name is Adan I lived in Tucson, AZ my whole life and have enjoyed the time I have sent here. I have met many great people and mentors and look forward to meeting much more.</p>
					<p>I'm a pretty big hobbyist and enjoy learning new things all the time, reading books, and researching differnt things. Some of the things that being a hobbiest has presented to me is welding, auto collision, airbrushing, sketch, and other medias of art. I currently work in a call center in the social media department responding to posts and I have to say it is not that bad, in fact it's pretty easy. There is much more to my time than sitting down all day responding to posts, and I'm ready to get my foot in the technological side of the industry and start exploring!</p>
